# Version 0.3.7

* Faster checking of valid configurations
* Fixes a bug in sampling configurations for SatenStein
* Fixes a bug getting neighbors from OrdinalHyperparameter
* Fixes a bug getting neighbors from a UniformIntegerHyperparameter
* Utility function to deactivate inactive, but specified hyperparameters
* Fixes a bug in retrieving the one exchange neighborhood, i.e. it could not
  change the value of parent parameters

# Version 0.3.6

* Minor speed improvements when checking forbidden clauses

# Version 0.3.5

* Even more speed improvements for highly conditional configurations
* Speed improvements for retrieving neighbor configurations

# Version 0.3.4

* Further improve sampling speed for highly conditional configuration spaces

# Version 0.3.3

* Improve sampling speed for highly conditional configuration spaces

# Version 0.3.2

* FIX: do not store `None` when calling `populate_values` on a Configuration
* FIX #26: raise Exception if argument has the wrong type.
* FIX #25: a bug related to sorting hyperparameters when reading them from a
  PCS files.

# Version 0.3.1

* MAINT: fix endless loop in `get_one_exchange_neighborhood`.

# Version 0.3

* MAINT: improve speed of `get_one_exchange_neighborhood`. This changes the
  return value of the function from a list to a generator.

# Version 0.2.3

* FIX: allow installation via `python setup.py install`
* MAINT: drop python2.7 support, add python3.6 support
* MAINT: improve performance of `add_configuration_space`
* FIX: a bug in `add_configuration_space` which changed the names of the
  hyperparameters of a child configuration space
* MAINT: new helper functions `add_hyperparameters` and `add_conditions`.

# Version 0.2.2

* ADD: two convenience functions to improve working with HPOlib2
* MAINT: default seed of ConfigurationSpace is now None instead of 1. This makes
  the package behave like other scientific programming packages.
* FIX: improve bounds checking for log-space hyperparameters
* FIX: version information is now in a separate file.
* MAINT: improve sampling speed by breaking the sampling loop earlier when
  possible

# Version 0.2.1

* FIX: bug which changed order of hyperparameters when adding new 
  hyperparameter. This was non-deterministic due to the use of dict instead 
  of OrderedDict.
* FIX: compare configurations with == instead of numpy.allclose.
* FIX: issue 2, syntax error no longer present during installation
* FIX: json serialization of configurations and their hyperparameters can now
       be deserialized by json and still compare equal 

# Version 0.2

* FIX: bug which made integer values have different float values in the 
  underlying vector representation.
* FIX: bug which could make two configuration spaces compare unequal due to 
  the use of defaultdict
* FEATURE: new feature add_configuration_space, which allows to add a whole 
  configuration space into an existing configuration space
* FEATURE: python3.5 support
* FIX: add function get_parent() to Conjunctions (issue #1)
* Added this Changelog.
