# done over the entire space of integers (int32/64).
# To combat this, `arange_chunked` is used in scenarios where reducion
# operations over all the elments could be done in partial steps independantly.
# For example, a sum over the pdf values could be done in chunks.
# This may add some small overhead for smaller ranges but is unlikely to
# be noticable.
