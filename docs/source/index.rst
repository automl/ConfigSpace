Welcome to ConfigSpace's documentation!
=======================================

ConfigSpace is a simple python package to manage configuration spaces for `algorithm configuration <https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/09-JAIR-ParamILS.pdf>`_ and
`hyperparameter optimization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization>`_ tasks.
It includes various modules to translate between different text formats for configuration space description.

ConfigSpace is often used in our tools such as `SMAC3`_, `BOHB`_ or `auto-sklearn`_.
To read more about our group and projects, visit our homepage `autoML.org <https://www.automl.org>`_.

The purpose of this documentation is to explain how to use
``ConfigurationSpace`` and show you its abilities. In the :doc:`quickstart` you
will see how to set up a ``ConfigurationSpace`` and add hyperparameters of
different types.
Besides containing hyperparameters, ``ConfigurationSpace`` is able to realize
constraints such as conditions and forbidden clauses
on the defined configurations space. (:math:`\rightarrow` :doc:`Guide`)
Furthermore, in the :ref:`serialization section <Serialization>`, it will be
explained how to serialize a defined *configuration space* for later usage.

Basic usage::

    import ConfigSpace as CS
    import ConfigSpace.hyperparameters as CSH

    cs = CS.ConfigurationSpace()
    a = CSH.UniformIntegerHyperparameter('a', lower=10, upper=100, log=False)
    b = CSH.CategoricalHyperparameter('b', choices=['red', 'green', 'blue'])

    cs.add_hyperparameters([a, b])
    cs.sample_configuration()

    # >>> Configuration:
    # >>>   a, Value: 97
    # >>>   b, Value: 'red'


Installation
============

The *ConfigSpace* can be installed with *pip*:

.. code:: bash

    pip install ConfigSpace

The *ConfigSpace* package requires *numpy*, *cython* and *pyparsing*. If you
want to use it with Python3.4 it also requires the *typing* package.
Additionally, a functioning C compiler is required.

On Ubuntu, the required compiler tools can be installed with:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

When using Anaconda/Miniconda, the compiler has to be installed with:

.. code:: bash

    conda install gxx_linux-64 gcc_linux-64
