Welcome to ConfigSpace's documentation!
=======================================

ConfigSpace is a simple python package to manage configuration spaces for `algorithm configuration <https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/09-JAIR-ParamILS.pdf>`_ and
`hyperparameter optimization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization>`_ tasks.
It includes various modules to translate between different text formats for configuration space description.

ConfigSpace is often used in our tools such as `SMAC3`_, `BOHB`_ or `auto-sklearn`_.
To read more about our group and projects, visit our homepage `autoML.org <https://www.automl.org>`_.

| The purpose of this documentation is to explain how to use ``ConfigurationSpace`` and show you its abilities.
| In the :doc:`quickstart` you will see how to set up a ``ConfigurationSpace`` and add hyperparameters of different types.
  Besides containing hyperparameters, ``ConfigurationSpace`` is able to realize constraints such as conditions and forbidden clauses
  on the defined configurations space. (:math:`\rightarrow` :doc:`Guide`)
| Furthermore, in the :ref:`serialization section <Serialization>`, it will be explained how to serialize a defined *configuration space* for later usage.

It can be installed using pip::

   pip install ConfigSpace

Basic usage::

    import ConfigSpace as CS
    import ConfigSpace.hyperparameters as CSH

    cs = CS.ConfigurationSpace()
    a = CSH.UniformIntegerHyperparameter('a', lower=10, upper=100, log=False)
    b = CSH.CategoricalHyperparameter('b', choices=['red', 'green', 'blue'])

    cs.add_hyperparameters([a, b])
    cs.sample_configuration()

    # >>> Configuration:
    # >>>   a, Value: 97
    # >>>   b, Value: 'red'
